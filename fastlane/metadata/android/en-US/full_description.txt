The application consists of a series of screens where it is possible to view data on the National or Regional trend relating to a specific day, a screen with the graph showing the temporal trend of the same measures followed then by some comparative statistics (such as the variation between consecutive days) and a vertical bar graph (Histogram) to compare a single measurement between the different regions. The project was born with the aim of offering citizens and the Open Source community a rapid channel for viewing the main data and statistics, useful information for communication and analysis purposes.
